# C++ Primer Example Modification Project

This project contains my recent explorations and modifications of example programs from the book *C++ Primer* (5th Edition) by Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo. The primary objective is to deepen my understanding of C++ by experimenting with and enhancing the provided examples.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into chapters corresponding to those in *C++ Primer*. Each chapter directory includes:

- **Original Examples**: Source code from the book's examples.
- **Modified Versions**: My adaptations and enhancements of these examples.
- **Notes**: Insights and explanations regarding the modifications.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples and modifications:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
